## Candy Storage Inventory Web App using MongoDB and Node.js
# Description
This project is a web application that allows you to manage a candy storage inventory. It uses Node.js as the backend language and MongoDB as the database. This web application has CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) endpoints that enable users to interact with the database and perform the necessary operations on the inventory.

The web application has the following endpoints:

1. GET /candies - Get all candies from the inventory.
2. GET /candies/:id - Get a specific candy from the inventory by ID.
3. POST /candies - Add a new candy to the inventory.
4. PUT /candies/:id - Update an existing candy in the inventory by ID.
5. DELETE /candies/:id - Remove a candy from the inventory by ID.  

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
